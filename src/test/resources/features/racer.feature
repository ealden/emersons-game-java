Feature: Emerson's Game
  
  Emerson's Game is a racing game that teaches proper software engineering, and why we should focus on quality.

  The game involves 2 or more racers on a race track, trying to cross the finish line.  Each racer takes turns,
  choosing whether they want to go NORMAL speed or SUPER speed, and then rolling the dice.  Each racer then moves
  the corresponding number of positions based on these rules:

   - If NORMAL speed and dice roll is ODD, move 1 position forward
   - If NORMAL speed and dice roll is EVEN, move 2 positions forward
   - If SUPER speed, move based on the dice roll, but take 1 damage each time
   - Damage is deducted to each roll

  Scenario Outline: Race
    Given I am in a race
    And   I am at position <Position>
    And   I have damage of <Damage>
    And   I see the finish line at position 10
    When  I choose "<Speed>" speed
    And   I roll a <Roll>
    Then  I must now be at position <New Position>
    And   I must now have damage of <New Damage>
    And   I must see the race result: <Result>
    And   I must now have a log entry with the following:
          * Position: <Position>
          * Damage: <Damage>
          * Speed: "<Speed>"
          * Roll: <Roll>
          * Move: <Move>
          * New Position: <New Position>
          * New Damage: <New Damage>
          * Crashed: <Crashed>
          * Win: <Win>

    Examples: NORMAL speed is move 1 for odd roll, 2 for even roll

      | Position  | Damage  | Speed   | Roll  | Move  | New Position  | New Damage  | Crashed | Win | Result  |
      | 0         | 0       | NORMAL  | 1     | 1     | 1             | 0           | NO      | NO  | --      |
      | 0         | 0       | NORMAL  | 2     | 2     | 2             | 0           | NO      | NO  | --      |
      | 0         | 0       | NORMAL  | 3     | 1     | 1             | 0           | NO      | NO  | --      |
      | 0         | 0       | NORMAL  | 4     | 2     | 2             | 0           | NO      | NO  | --      |
      | 0         | 0       | NORMAL  | 5     | 1     | 1             | 0           | NO      | NO  | --      |
      | 0         | 0       | NORMAL  | 6     | 2     | 2             | 0           | NO      | NO  | --      |

    Examples: SUPER speed is move based on roll but take 2 damage every time we roll

      | Position  | Damage  | Speed   | Roll  | Move  | New Position  | New Damage  | Crashed | Win | Result  |
      | 0         | 0       | SUPER   | 1     | 1     | 1             | 2           | NO      | NO  | --      |
      | 0         | 0       | SUPER   | 2     | 2     | 2             | 2           | NO      | NO  | --      |
      | 0         | 0       | SUPER   | 3     | 3     | 3             | 2           | NO      | NO  | --      |
      | 0         | 0       | SUPER   | 4     | 4     | 4             | 2           | NO      | NO  | --      |
      | 0         | 0       | SUPER   | 5     | 5     | 5             | 2           | NO      | NO  | --      |

    Examples: Damage is deducted from each roll

      | Position  | Damage  | Speed   | Roll  | Move  | New Position  | New Damage  | Crashed | Win | Result  |
      | 1         | 1       | NORMAL  | 1     | 0     | 1             | 1           | NO      | NO  | --      |

    And   I am at position 2
    And   I have damage of 1
    And   I see the finish line at position 10
    When  I choose to start over in a new race
    Then  I must now be at position 0
    And   I must now have damage of 0
    And   I must see the race result: --

  Scenario: Welcome Message
    When  I am in a race
    Then  I must see the message: "Time to RACE! Alice rolls first!"

  Scenario Outline: Message
    Given I am in a race
    And   I am at position <Position>

    And   I see the finish line at position 10
    When  I choose "<Speed>" speed
    And   I roll a <Roll>
    Then  I must see the message: "<Message>"
